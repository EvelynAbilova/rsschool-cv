# About me

I started the JS/Frontend course in order to gain knowledge on the topic of interest to me, since the curriculum in my specialty at the university almost did not cover this area in any way. I want to develop in this direction and find a job in the future. Due to the fact that I currently have no classes at the university, I have more free time that I want to devote to self-development. In 2020, I had a little experience writing python scripts for parsing data from a CRM system.

# Programming languages/frameworks

* Python
* Tensorflow
* PyTorch
* Keras

# Education

At the moment I am studying in the 4th year of the BSU FAMC, I am in the process of writing a diploma.

# Code example

write a function that removes vowels from a string
```
import re

def disemvowel(string_):
    if re.search('[aeiouAEIOU]', string_):
        return re.sub('[aeiouAEIOU]','',string_)
    else:
        return string_
```
